<blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><b><i><font size="2">Rogue</font></i></b><font size="2"> is a visual CRT based fantasy game which runs under the 
							UNIX† timesharing system. This paper describes how

<h2 align="justify"><b>1. Introduction</b></h2>

<p align="justify">You have just finished your years as a
student at the local fighter&rsquo;s guild. After much
practice and sweat you have finally completed your training
and are ready to embark upon a perilous adventure. As a test
of your skills, the local guildmasters have sent you into
the Dungeons of Doom. Your task is to return with the Amulet
of Yendor. Your reward for the completion of this task will
be a full membership in the local guild. In addition, you
are allowed to keep all the loot you bring back from the
dungeons.</p>

<p align="justify">In preparation for your journey, you are
given an enchanted mace, a bow, and a quiver of arrows taken
from a dragon&rsquo;s hoard in the far off Dark Mountains.
You are also outfitted with elf-crafted armor and given
enough food to reach the dungeons. You say goodbye to family
and friends for what may be the last time and head up the
road.</p>

<p align="justify">You set out on your way to the dungeons and
after several days of uneventful travel, you see the
ancient ruins that mark the entrance to the Dungeons of
Doom. It is late at night, so you make camp at the entrance
and spend the night sleeping under the open skies. In the
morning you gather your weapons, put on your armor, eat what
is almost your last food, and enter the
dungeons.</p>

<h2 align="justify"><b>2. What is going on here?</b></h2>
<p align="justify">You have just begun a game of rogue. Your
goal is to grab as much treasure as you can, find the Amulet
of Yendor, and get out of the Dungeons of Doom alive. On the
screen, a map of where you have been and what you have seen
on the current dungeon level is kept. As you explore more of
the level, it appears on the screen in front of
you.</p>
<p align="justify">Rogue differs from most computer fantasy
games in that it is screen oriented. Commands are all one or
two keystrokes<sup>1 </sup>and the
results of your commands are displayed graphically on the
screen rather than being explained in words<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p align="justify">Another major difference between rogue and other computer fantasy games is that once you have solved
all the puzzles in a standard fantasy game, it has lost most
of its excitement and it ceases to be fun. Rogue, on the
other hand, generates a new dungeon every time you play it
and even the author finds it an entertaining and exciting
game.</p>

<h2 align="justify"><b>3. What do all those things on the screen mean?</b></h2>
<p align="justify">In order to understand what is going on in
rogue you have to first get some grasp of what rogue is
doing with the screen. The rogue screen is intended to
replace the &ldquo;You can see ...&rdquo; descriptions of
standard fantasy games. Figure 1 is a sample of what a 
rogue screen might look like.</p>

<h3 align="justify"><b>3.1. The bottom line</b></h3>
<p align="justify">At the bottom line of the screen are a few
pieces of cryptic information describing your current
status. Here is an explanation of what these things
mean:<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<table border="0" width="100%" id="table1" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
	<tr>
		<td width="7%" valign="top">
		<p align="justify">Level</td>

you go deeper into the dungeon.</td>

	<tr>
		<td valign="top">
		<p align="justify">Hp</td>
		<td>
		<p align="justify">Your current and maximum health points.
Health points indicate how much damage you can take before
you die. The more you get hit in a fight, the lower they
get. You can regain health points by resting. The number in
parentheses is the maximum number your health points can
reach.</p>

		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">
		<p align="justify">Str</td>
		<td>

<p align="justify">Your current strength and maximum ever
strength. This can be any integer less than or equal to 31,
or greater than or equal to three. The higher the num- ber,
the stronger you are. The number in the parentheses is the
maximum strength you have attained so far this
game.</p>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">
		<p align="justify">Arm</td>

		<p align="justify">Your current armor protection. This
number indicates how effective your armor is in stopping
blows from unfriendly creatures. The higher this number is,
the more effective the armor.</p>

	<tr>
		<td valign="top">
		<p align="justify">Exp</td>
		<td>
		<p align="justify">These two numbers give your current
experience level and experience points. As you do things,

magical attacks.</p>

<h3 align="justify"><b>3.2. The top line</b></h3>
<p align="justify">The top line of the screen is reserved for
printing messages that describe things that are impossible
to represent visually. If you see a &ldquo;--More--&rdquo;
on the top line, this means that rogue wants to print
another message on the screen, but it wants to make certain
that you have read the one that is there first. To read the
next message, just type a space.</p>


<h3 align="justify"><b>3.3. The rest of the screen</b></h3>
<p align="justify">The rest of the screen is the map of the
level as you have explored it so far. Each symbol on the
screen repre- sents something. Here is a list of what the
various symbols mean:</p>

<h2 align="justify"><b>4. Commands</b></h2>
<p align="justify">Commands are given to rogue by typing one or two characters. 
Most commands can be preceded by a count to repeat them (e.g. typing “10s” will 
do ten searches). Commands for which counts make no sense have the count 
ignored. To cancel a count or a prefix, type &lt;ESCAPE&gt; . The list of commands is
rather long, but it can be read at any time during the game
with the &ldquo;?&rdquo; command. Here it is for reference,
with a short explanation of each
command.<br>

		<td align="left" valign="top">
		<p>/</td>
		<td align="justify">
		<p>This is the “What is that on the screen?” command. A

		the specified direction until you pass something interesting or run into 
		a wall. You should experiment with this, since it is a very useful

<h2 align="justify"><b>5. Rooms</b></h2>
<p align="justify">Rooms in the dungeons are either lit or
dark. If you walk into a lit room, the entire room will be
drawn on the screen as soon as you enter. If you walk into a
dark room, it will only be displayed as you explore it. Upon
leaving a room, all monsters inside the room are erased from
the screen. In the darkness you can only see one space in
all directions around you. A corridor is always
dark.</p>

<h2 align="justify"><b>6. Fighting</b></h2>
<p align="justify">If you see a monster and you wish to fight
it, just attempt to run into it. Many times a monster you
find will mind its own business unless you attack it. It is
often the case that discretion is the better part of
valor.</p>

<h2 align="justify"><b>7. Objects you can find</b></h2>
<p align="justify">When you find something in the dungeon, it
is common to want to pick the object up. This is
accomplished in rogue by walking over the object (unless you
use the &ldquo;m&rdquo; prefix, see above). If you are
carrying too many things, the pro- gram will tell you and it
won&rsquo;t pick up the object, other- wise it will add it
to your pack and tell you what you just picked
up.</p>

<p align="justify">Many of the commands that operate on
objects must prompt you to find out which object you want to
use. If you change your mind and don&rsquo;t want to do that
command after all, just type an
&lt;ESCAPE&gt; and the command will be
aborted.</p>

<p align="justify">Some objects, like armor and weapons, are
easily dif- ferentiated. Others, like scrolls and potions,
are given labels which vary according to type. During a
game, any two of the same kind of object with the same label
are the same type. However, the labels will vary from game
to game.</p>

<p align="justify">When you use one of these labeled objects,
if its effect is obvious, rogue will remember what it is for
you. If it&rsquo;s effect isn&rsquo;t extremely obvious you
will be asked what you want to scribble on it so you will
recognize it later, or you can use the &ldquo;call&rdquo;
command (see above).</p>

<h3 align="justify"><b>7.1. Weapons</b></h3>
<p align="justify">Some weapons, like arrows, come in bunches,
but most come one at a time. In order to use a weapon, you
must wield it. To fire an arrow out of a bow, you must first
wield the bow, then throw the arrow. You can only wield one
weapon at a time, but you can&rsquo;t change weapons if the
one you are currently wielding is cursed. The commands to
use weapons are &ldquo;w&rdquo; (wield) and &ldquo;t&rdquo;
(throw).</p>

<h3 align="justify"><b>7.2. Armor</b></h3>

<p align="justify">There are various sorts of armor lying around in the dungeon. Some of it is 
enchanted, some is cursed, and some is just normal. Different armor types have 
different armor protection. The higher the armor protection, the more protection the armor affords against the blows of
monsters. Here is a list of the various armor types and
their normal armor protection:</p>

If a piece of armor is enchanted, its
armor protection will be higher than normal. If a suit of
armor is cursed, its armor protection will be lower, and you
will not be able to remove it. However, not all armor with a
protection that is lower than normal is
cursed.

</p>

<p align="justify">The commands to use weapons are
&ldquo;W&rdquo; (wear) and &ldquo;T&rdquo; (take
off).</p>

<h3 align="justify">

<b>7.3. Scrolls</b></h3>
<p align="justify">Scrolls come with titles in an unknown tongue<sup>3</sup>. After you read a scroll, it 
disappears from your pack. The com mand to use a
scroll is &ldquo;r&rdquo; (read).</p>

<h3 align="justify">

<b>7.4. Potions</b>

</h3>

<p align="justify">Potions are labeled by the color of the
liquid inside the flask. They disappear after being quaffed.
The command to use a scroll is &ldquo;q&rdquo;
(quaff).</p>

<h3 align="justify"><b>7.5. Staves and Wands</b></h3>
<p align="justify">Staves and wands do the same kinds of
things. Staves are identified by a type of wood; wands by a
type of metal or bone. They are generally things you want to
do to some- thing over a long distance, so you must point
them at what you wish to affect to use them. Some staves are
not affected by the direction they are pointed, though.
Staves come with multiple magic charges, the number being
random, and when they are used up, the staff is just a piece
of wood or metal.</p>

<p align="justify">The command to use a wand or staff is
&ldquo;z&rdquo; (zap)</p>

<h3 align="justify"><b>7.6. Rings</b></h3>

<p align="justify">Rings are very useful items, since they are
relatively permanent magic, unlike the usually fleeting
effects of potions, scrolls, and staves. Of course, the bad
rings are also more powerful. Most rings also cause you to
use up food more rapidly, the rate varying with the type of
ring. Rings are differentiated by their stone settings. The
com- mands to use rings are &ldquo;P&rdquo; (put on) and
&ldquo;R&rdquo; (remove).</p>

<h3 align="justify"><b>7.7. Food</b></h3>

<p align="justify">Food is necessary to keep you going. If you
go too long without eating you will faint, and eventually
die of starvation. The command to use food is
&ldquo;e&rdquo; (eat).</p>

<h2 align="justify"><b>8. Options</b></h2>
<p align="justify">Due to variations in personal tastes and
conceptions of the way rogue should do things, there are a
set of options you can set that cause rogue to behave in
various different ways.</p>

<h3 align="justify"><b>8.1 Setting the options</b></h3>

<p align="justify">There are two ways to set the options. The
first is with the &ldquo;o&rdquo; command of rogue; the
second is with the &ldquo;ROGUEOPTS&rdquo; environment
variable.</p>

<h3 align="justify"><b>8.1.1. Using the &lsquo;o&rsquo; command</b></h3>

<p align="justify">When you type &ldquo;o&rdquo; in rogue, it
clears the screen and displays the current settings for all
the options. It then places the cursor by the value of the
first option and waits for you to type. You can type a
&lt;RETURN&gt; which means to go to the next
option, a &ldquo;&minus;&rdquo; which means to go to the
previous option, an &lt;ESCAPE&gt; which
means to return to the game, or you can give the option a
value. For boolean options this merely involves typing
&ldquo;t&rdquo; for true or &ldquo;f&rdquo; for false. For
string options, type the new value followed by a
&lt;RETURN&gt; .</p>

<h3 align="justify"><b>8.1.2. Using the ROGUEOPTS variable</b></h3>

<p align="justify">The ROGUEOPTS variable is a string
containing a comma separated list of initial values for the
various options. Boolean variables can be turned on by
listing their name or turned off by putting a
&ldquo;no&rdquo; in front of the name. Thus to set up an
environment variable so that <b>jump</b> is on, <b>terse</b>
is off, and the <b>name</b> is set to &ldquo;Blue
Meanie&rdquo;, use the command</p>

<p align="justify">% setenv ROGUEOPTS
&quot;jump,noterse,name=Blue Meanie&quot;<sup>4</sup></p>

<h3 align="justify"><b>8.2. Option list</b></h3>

<p align="justify">Here is a list of the options and an
explanation of what each one is for. The default value for
each is enclosed in square brackets. For character string
options, input over fifty characters will be
ignored.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>terse</b>
[<i>noterse</i>]</p>
<blockquote>
	<p align="justify">
	Useful for those who are tired of the
sometimes lengthy messages of rogue. This is a useful option
for playing on slow terminals, so this option defaults to
<i>terse</i> if you are on a slow (1200 baud or under)
terminal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="justify"><b>jump</b>
[<i>nojump</i>]</p>
<blockquote>
	<p align="justify">If this option is set, running moves will
not be displayed until you reach the end of the move. This
saves considerable cpu and display time. This option
defaults to <i>jump</i> if you are using a slow
terminal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b>flush</b>
[<i>noflush</i>]</p>
<blockquote>
	<p align="justify">All typeahead is thrown away after each round of battle. This is useful for those who type far
ahead and then watch in dismay as a Bat kills
them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b>seefloor</b>
[<i>seefloor</i>]</p>
<blockquote>
	<p align="justify">Display the floor around you on the screen
as you move through dark rooms. Due to the amount of
characters generated, this option defaults to
<i>noseefloor</i> if you are using a slow
terminal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b>passgo</b>
[<i>nopassgo</i>]</p>
<blockquote>
	<p align="justify">Follow turnings in passageways. If you run
in a pas- sage and you run into stone or a wall, rogue will
see if it can turn to the right or left. If it can only turn
one way, it will turn that way. If it can turn either or
neither, it will stop. This algorithm can sometimes lead to
slightly confusing occurrences which is why it defaults to
<i>nopassgo</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b>tombstone</b>
[<i>tombstone</i>]</p>
<blockquote>
	<p align="justify">Print out the tombstone at the end if you
get killed. This is nice but slow, so you can turn it off if
you like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b>inven</b>
[<i>overwrite</i>]</p>
<blockquote>
	<p align="justify">Inventory type. This can have one of three
values: <i>overwrite</i>, <i>slow</i>, or <i>clear</i>. With
<i>overwrite</i> the top lines of the map are overwritten
with the list when inventory is requested or when
&ldquo;Which item do you wish to <b>. . .</b>? &rdquo;
questions are answered with a &ldquo;*&rdquo;. How- ever, if
the list is longer than a screenful, the screen is cleared.
With <i>slow</i>, lists are displayed one item at a time on
the top of the screen, and with <i>clear</i>, the screen is
cleared, the list is displayed, and then the dungeon level
is re-displayed. Due to speed considerations, <i>clear</i>
is the default for terminals without clear-to-end-of-line
capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b>name</b> [account
name]</p>
<blockquote>
	<p align="justify">This is the name of your character. It is
used if you get on the top ten scorer&rsquo;s
list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b>fruit</b>
[<i>slime-mold</i>]</p>
<blockquote>
	<p align="justify">This should hold the name of a fruit that
you enjoy eating. It is basically a whimsy that rogue uses
in a couple of places.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b>file</b>
[<i>~/rogue.save</i>]</p>
<blockquote>
	<p align="justify">The default file name for saving the game.
If your phone is hung up by accident, rogue will
automatically save the game in this file. The file name may
start with the special character &ldquo;~&rdquo; which
expands to be your home directory.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 align="justify"><b>9. Scoring</b></h2>

<p align="justify">Rogue usually maintains a list of the top
scoring people or scores on your machine. Depending on how
it is set up, it can post either the top scores or the top
players. In the latter case, each account on the machine can
post only one non-winning score on this list. If you score
higher than someone else on this list, or better your previous score on the list, you will be inserted in the proper
place under your current name. How many scores are kept can
also be set up by whoever installs it on your
machine.</p>

<p align="justify">If you quit the game, you get out with all
of your gold intact. If, however, you get killed in the
Dungeons of Doom, your body is forwarded to your
next-of-kin, along with 90% of your gold; ten percent of
your gold is kept by the Dungeons&rsquo; wizard as a fee<sup>5</sup>. This should make you
consider whether you want to take one last hit at that
monster and possibly live, or quit and thus stop with
whatever you have. If you quit, you do get all your gold,
but if you swing and live, you might find
more.</p>

<p align="justify">If you just want to see what the current top players/games list is, you can
type</p>
<p align="justify">% @PROGRAM@ &minus;s</p>
