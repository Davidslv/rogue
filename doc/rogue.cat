NAME
       rogue - Exploring The Dungeons of Doom

SYNOPSIS
       @PROGRAM@ [ -r ] [ save_file ] [ -s ] [ -d ]

DESCRIPTION
       Rogue  is a computer fantasy game with a new twist.  It is crt oriented
       and the object of the game is to survive the attacks  of  various  mon-
       sters and get a lot of gold, rather than the puzzle solving orientation
       of most computer fantasy games.

       To get started you really only need to know two commands.  The  command
       ?   will  give  you  a list of the available commands and the command /
       will identify the things you see on the screen.

       To win the game (as opposed to merely playing to  beat  other  people's
       high  scores)  you  must locate the Amulet of Yendor which is somewhere
       below the 20th level of  the  dungeon  and  get  it  out.   Nobody  has
       achieved  this  yet and if somebody does, they will probably go down in
       history as a hero among heroes.

       When the game ends, either by your death, when you quit, or if you  (by
       some  miracle) manage to win, rogue will give you a list of the top-ten
       scorers.  The scoring is based entirely upon how  much  gold  you  get.
       There is a 10% penalty for getting yourself killed.

       If  save_file  is  specified, rogue will be restored from the specified
       saved game file.  If the -r option is used, the save game file is  pre-
       sumed to be the default.

       The -s option will print out the list of scores.

       The -d option will kill you and try to add you to the score file.

       For more detailed directions, read the document A Guide to the Dungeons
       of Doom.

BUGS
       Probably  infinite  (although  countably  infinite).  However, that Ice
       Monsters sometimes transfix you permanently is not a bug.  It's a  fea-
       ture.
